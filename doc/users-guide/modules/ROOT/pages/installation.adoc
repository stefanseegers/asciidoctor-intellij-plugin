[#prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

To use this plugin, you need to have one of the IntelliJ family of IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, WebStorm or PyCharm installed.

All default download packages include the JetBrains Runtime 11, a pre-bundled OpenJDK runtime environment.
Please use the pre-bundled JetBrains Runtime to run the IDE as it includes JavaFX (which is required for a rich preview) and proves to be the most stable.

If you've already installed the IDE and the plugin, continue to section xref:features.adoc[].

If you have the IDE installed already, continue to the next section <<installplugin>>.

If you are looking for a free version of the IDE, choose IntelliJ IDEA Community edition.
All other IDEs require a paid subscription.
You can still download them and use them with a free, time-limited evaluation subscription.

You can download them from the JetBrains homepage: link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/[^]
