= Antora

When working in an https://antora.org/[Antora project], the plugin supports:

* Attributes _partialsdir_, _examplesdir_, _attachmentsdir_, _imagesdir_ and _pagesdir_ resolve to their absolute path of the partials, examples, attachments, images and pages folder of the current module.
This way the following resolves in the editor and the preview:
+
----
\include::{partialsdir}/test.adoc[]
----

* Reference other components and modules resolve for xref, image and include macros.
The following works in the editor (xref, include and image) and in the preview (for include and image):
+
----
\include::component:module:partial$snippet.adoc[]
xref::component:module:document.adoc[]
image::my-image-in-the-current-module.png[]
image::component:module:my-image-in-another-module.png[]
----
